                OAuth is the biggest pile of crap and any security benefits that there might be are vastly out-matched by the constant annoyance that is using it.

                What I love in my life is whenever I try and log into a website, I have to play this game where I have to figure out, "which OAuth provider did I create an account with?"

                At any company, you'll end up having to have jobs that "keep the lights on". This is common and to be expected. Much the same as when you own a home, someone's gotta do the dishes.
              </p>
                <p>
                    There is a common dysfunction that occurs in companies though, which doesn't usually happen at home. People end up getting an ever-growing set of responsibilities, without an equivalently growing agency to do them.

                As a .NET developer working on MacOS, you'll likely run into a situation 
                where you're trying to use a backed up version of your SQLServer database 
                and do some testing. But, you'll find that the current release of VSCode's 
                MSSQL package doesn't support .bacpac imports right now.

                Have you ever had a moment where you find a commander and you think
                it's cool but you're not sure if there will be enough cards available
                to make the deck run smoothly, or you weren't sure if it will feel
                good to play so you've not wanted to waste time brewing up a 100-card
                deck? Well, in this guide, I'm going to show you how you can
                dramatically reduce the time it takes to test out a deck idea or even
                just a commander.

                With thousands of cards to choose from and countless strategies to explore,
                it's easy to feel lost. This guide is designed to help new players step
                into the world of Commander. We'll start by commanders that are perfect
                for beginners. Then, we'll walk you through a simple framework for building
                your first deck. Finally, we'll give you a few extra tools to help you
                refine your deck as you play and make it your own!

                Starting out in the industry there's been one thing I've heard continually:
                Rust is cool, and you should learn it. So, after endless nagging by a few colleagues
                and the swathes of social media that pushes it, I've made the plunge…
